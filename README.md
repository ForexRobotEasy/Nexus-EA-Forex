Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We only provide this sample code as an example of how the product can work.

## How It Works

The code starts by including the necessary libraries for trading, trend analysis, and oscillators. It then defines some constants and initializes the trading functions.

Next, the code defines a set of entry conditions for trading, represented by an enum (EC_1, EC_2, EC_3, etc.). These conditions can be used to determine when to enter the market.

The code also defines a set of market analysis decision-making indicators, represented by another enum (DI_1, DI_2, DI_3, DI_4). These indicators can be used to perform additional analysis for making trading decisions.

The main function of the code is `ExecuteAlgorithm()`. Here, technical and price action analysis is performed using the Trend and Oscillator indicators. Additional market analysis is then performed using the DI indicators. Based on the analysis, a market entry condition is selected using the `SelectEntryCondition()` function.

Once the entry condition is determined, the code executes a trade based on the selected condition. If the condition is EC_1, a buy order is placed. If the condition is EC_2, a sell order is placed. The code can be extended to include more entry conditions and corresponding trade actions.

The `SelectEntryCondition()` function is responsible for selecting the entry condition based on the analysis. The logic for selecting the condition can be customized in this function.

The `GetDI()` function is used to retrieve the value of a DI indicator based on the specified indicator enum value. The logic for retrieving the DI value can be customized in this function.

The program follows the standard MQL5 structure, with the `OnInit()`, `OnTick()`, and `OnDeinit()` functions. The `OnInit()` function initializes the trading settings and executes the trading algorithm. The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick and also executes the trading algorithm. The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the program is terminated and can be used to perform cleanup tasks.

## Usage

To use this code, you will need to have the Nexus EA Forex software installed. You can find the official developer of this product by using MQL5.
